### [Towards Co-Humanity](https://co-humanity.com)

The Co-humanity blog begins in the critical times of the Covid-19. It is an open invitation for sharing personal reflections that are situated in concrete communities. Contributors come from diverse countries and professions, speak a variety of mother tongues, and were born in different ages. The initiative seeks to build caring connections for more engaged futures.
